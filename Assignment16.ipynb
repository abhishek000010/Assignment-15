    "What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data stored in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of information. \n",
    "Databases are widely used in applications such as websites, banking systems, inventory management systems, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational model and use SQL for querying and managing data. Data in SQL databases is organized into tables with predefined schema and relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are known for their ability to enforce data integrity, consistency, and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models to store data, including document, key-value, graph, and column-family stores. NoSQL databases do not rely on fixed schemas, and they offer flexible data modeling capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which makes them a popular choice for web applications that require high scalability and performance. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases is in the way they store and manage data. SQL databases are based on the relational model, have predefined schemas, and use SQL for querying and managing data.\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, offer flexible data modeling capabilities, and do not rely on fixed schemas. They use various data models and offer horizontal scalability. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as scalability, performance, data consistency, and flexibility."

    "Q2 -> What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -> DDL (Data Definition Language) is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. DDL commands are used to define the structure of the database schema and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four most commonly used DDL commands in SQL are CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE. Here's an explanation of each command and an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE - This command is used to create a new table or other database objects. For example, the following SQL code creates a new table named customers:\n",
    "    \n",
    "# example \n",
    "create table customer (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,\n",
    "    age INT \n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP - This command is used to delete an existing database object. For example, the following SQL code drops the customers table:\n",
    "\n",
    "# rxample of drop \n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER - This command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, the following SQL code adds a new column phone to the customers table:\n",
    "    \n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLOUMN phone VARCHAR(28);\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE - This command is used to delete all data from an existing table. For example, the following SQL code truncates the customers table:\n",

    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans -> DML (Data Manipulation Language) is a set of SQL commands used to manipulate data in a database. DML commands are used to insert, update, and delete data from database tables.\n",
    "The three most commonly used DML commands in SQL are INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Here's an explanation of each command and an example:\n",

    "INSERT - This command is used to insert new data into a table. For example, the following SQL code inserts a new row into the customers table:\n",

    "VALUES(1, 'John DOe' , 'john@example.com' , 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE - This command is used to update existing data in a table. For example, the following SQL code updates the email address of the customer with id 1 in the customers table:\n",
    "# example of update\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE customers \n",
    "SET email = 'jddoe@example.com';\n",
    "WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE - This command is used to delete data from a table. For example, the following SQL code deletes the customer with id 1 from the customers table:\n",

    "# example of delete \n",
    "DELETE FROM customer \n",
